# üîß DateTime Fix - Rebuild Instructions

## Current Status
‚úÖ Code has been fixed to use local time
‚úÖ Utility verified working (shows 05:46 local vs 03:46 UTC)
‚è≥ **Application needs rebuild to apply changes**

## Quick Rebuild Steps

### 1. Rebuild the Application
```bash
yarn build
```

### 2. Restart the Application
Close and restart the app completely

### 3. Test with New Data
Create a **new order** or **new table** to test

## Expected Behavior After Rebuild

### ‚úÖ NEW Data (created after rebuild)
- Will use **device local time** (GMT+0200 in your case)
- Orders created at 05:46 local will show **05:46**, not 03:46
- All new timestamps will be correct

### ‚ö†Ô∏è OLD Data (created before rebuild)
- Will still show **UTC time** (the time when it was created)
- This is normal - it was stored as UTC before the fix
- Example: Order from 03:46 UTC will still show 03:46

## How to Verify the Fix Works

### Create a Test Order:
1. Note your current local time (e.g., 05:50)
2. Create a new order
3. Check the order's created time
4. **Expected**: Should show 05:50 (your local time)
5. **NOT**: 03:50 (UTC time)

### Time Difference Check:
Your timezone: **GMT+0200** (2 hours ahead of UTC)
- Local time: 05:46
- UTC time: 03:46
- Difference: 2 hours ‚úÖ

If new orders show time 2 hours behind your clock, the old code is still running.

## Troubleshooting

### If timestamps are still wrong after rebuild:

1. **Check if rebuild completed successfully**
   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```
   Look for any errors in the output

2. **Completely close and restart the app**
   - Don't just refresh
   - Fully quit and reopen

3. **Clear any cached builds**
   ```bash
   rm -rf dist
   rm -rf out
   yarn build
   ```

4. **Verify the code was actually updated**
   Check that `main/utils/dateTime.ts` exists:
   ```bash
   ls -la main/utils/dateTime.ts
   ```

5. **Check console for errors**
   Open developer tools and check for any import errors

## Files Modified

### Code Changes (38 files):
- All services (orderService, tableService, etc.)
- All controllers
- All models
- All utilities

### Database Schema:
- `main/db/schema.sql` - Updated all datetime defaults

### New Files:
- `main/utils/dateTime.ts` - Local time utility ‚ú®

## Support

If timestamps are still showing UTC after rebuilding:
1. Check the build output for errors
2. Verify the app was fully restarted
3. Create a NEW order to test (old data will keep UTC time)
4. Check developer console for any JavaScript errors

**Note**: This is NOT a database migration. Old data keeps its original timestamps. Only new data uses local time going forward.
