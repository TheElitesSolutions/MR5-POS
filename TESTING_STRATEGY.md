If critical issues are found:

### Immediate Rollback

```bash
# 1. Stop the application
# Close Electron app or stop dev server

# 2. Check current branch
git branch

# 3. Rollback to previous commit
git log --oneline -5  # See last 5 commits
git checkout [commit-hash-before-design-system]

# 4. Rebuild
yarn install
yarn build

# 5. Test that old version works
yarn dev
```

### Partial Rollback

If only specific files are problematic:

```bash
# Rollback specific file
git checkout [commit-hash] -- path/to/file.tsx

# Example: Rollback only login page
git checkout HEAD~1 -- renderer/app/(public)/login/page.tsx

# Rebuild
yarn build
```

### Git Bisect (Find Problem Commit)

```bash
# Start bisect
git bisect start

# Mark current as bad
git bisect bad

# Mark last known good commit
git bisect good [commit-hash]

# Git will checkout commits for you to test
# After each test, mark as good or bad:
git bisect good  # or
git bisect bad

# When found, note the commit and reset
git bisect reset
```

## Conclusion

This testing strategy covers:

✅ **Visual Regression** - Ensure design system looks correct
✅ **Functional Testing** - Ensure everything works
✅ **Performance Testing** - Ensure it's fast enough on old hardware
✅ **Platform-Specific** - Ensure Electron/Windows 10 compatibility
✅ **Accessibility** - Ensure it's usable by everyone

Follow this strategy systematically, and document all findings using the bug report template. The goal is to validate that the design system implementation improves the user experience without breaking existing functionality.

**Estimated Total Testing Time**: 8-12 hours across 3 days

Good luck with testing! 🚀
